## FAQ
### What is a User Agent?
It's a string of text your browser sends to websites to say 'Hi, I'm Chrome on Windows'.

### Why is the string so messy?
History! Browsers pretend to be other browsers (like 'Mozilla') so old websites still work.

### Can I change my User Agent?
Yes, developers do this to test how websites look on different phones or tablets.

### Does it detect bots?
Yes! If you paste a Googlebot string, I'll tell you it's a crawler.

### Is it secure?
Yes. I parse the string locally in your browser.

### What is the 'Engine'?
It's the core code that draws the webpage. Chrome uses Blink, Firefox uses Gecko.

### Is this useful for privacy?
Yes, it shows you exactly what device info you are sharing with every site you visit.
