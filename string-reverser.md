## Definition
The String Reverser is a simple yet powerful tool that inverts the order of text. It offers three distinct modes: 'Reverse Characters' (flips the entire string like a mirror), 'Reverse Words' (keeps words intact but changes their order), and 'Reverse Sentences' (reorders sentences while keeping their internal structure). This tool is useful for programmers debugging data, creative writers experimenting with structure, or simply for fun (like checking for palindromes).

## FAQ
### What is a palindrome?
It's a word like 'racecar' that is the same backwards and forwards. I can help you check if your text is one!

### Does it handle emojis?
Yes! I don't break emojis. '😀' reversed is still '😀'.

### How does 'Reverse Words' work?
I keep the words spelled correctly but swap their order. 'Hello World' becomes 'World Hello'.

### How does 'Reverse Sentences' work?
I look for periods and exclamation marks, then swap the order of the sentences while keeping the words inside them correct.

### Can I reverse a list?
Yes. If you use 'Reverse Characters', the whole list flips upside down. 'Reverse Words' is great for lists of names.

### Is this useful for encryption?
No! Reversing text is not secure. Anyone can flip it back. Use my Encryption tools for that.

### Does it work with Right-to-Left languages?
It reverses the characters. For Arabic or Hebrew, this might make the text unreadable, which might be what you want for a cool effect!
