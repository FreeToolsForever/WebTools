## FAQ
### What is a slug?
It's the end part of a URL (like /my-cool-post). It tells Google and people what the page is about.

### Why use hyphens instead of underscores?
Google prefers hyphens. It reads 'my-post' as 'my post'. It reads 'my_post' as 'mypost'. Hyphens are better for SEO.

### Does it handle foreign characters?
Yes! I turn 'café' into 'cafe'. I try to keep the URL readable for everyone.

### Does it remove stop words?
I keep all your words to be safe. You can delete 'the' or 'and' manually if you want a shorter URL.

### Is there a maximum length?
I don't limit you, but for SEO, try to keep it under 60 characters so it doesn't get cut off in search results.

### Can I use this for file names?
Yes! These slugs are perfect for file names because they have no spaces or weird symbols.

### Does it preserve numbers?
Yes. 'Top 10 Tips' becomes 'top-10-tips'.

### Is the process reversible?
No. Once I remove the special characters and uppercase letters, I can't put them back exactly how they were.
