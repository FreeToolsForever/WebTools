## Definition
The PNG to JPG Converter is a utility that transforms images from the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format to the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPG/JPEG) format. PNGs are known for lossless compression and transparency support, while JPGs are known for high compression and smaller file sizes, making them ideal for photographs. When converting, this tool automatically fills any transparent areas in the PNG with a white background, as JPG does not support transparency. This is essential for reducing file sizes for web use.

## FAQ
### What happens to transparent backgrounds?
JPG doesn't support transparency, so I fill the background with white automatically.

### Is JPG better than PNG?
For photos, yes! JPGs are much smaller. For logos or text, PNG is usually sharper.

### Will I lose quality?
A little bit, because JPG compresses the image. But I use high-quality settings so you probably won't notice.

### Can I convert multiple files?
One at a time for now. I'm working on a batch mode!

### Is it secure?
Yes. The conversion happens in your browser. Your images are never uploaded.

### Why is the file size smaller?
JPG is designed for photos. It throws away invisible data to make the file much smaller.

### Can I change the background color?
Right now it's always white. I might add a color picker later!
