## FAQ
### What is Regex?
It stands for Regular Expressions. It's a power-user way to search. You can say 'find all emails' or 'find all numbers' with a special code.

### Is it case sensitive?
It's up to you! There's a toggle to turn case sensitivity on or off.

### Does it support capture groups?
Yes! If you know Regex, you can use parentheses () to capture parts of the text and use $1, $2 to put them in the replacement.

### Can I replace newlines?
Yes. In Regex mode, use '\n' to find or add new lines.

### Is there an Undo button?
You can use Ctrl+Z (or Cmd+Z on Mac) right in the text box to undo your changes.

### Can I save my search patterns?
Not yet, but that's a great idea for a future update!

### Is it secure?
Yes. I don't send your text anywhere. It all stays on your computer.
