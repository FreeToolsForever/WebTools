## FAQ
### What is Binary?
It's the language of computers, using only 0s and 1s.

### What is Hexadecimal?
It's a base-16 system (0-9, A-F). It's a shorter way to write binary.

### Why use Octal?
It's base-8. It's used in things like Unix file permissions (chmod 777).

### Can I convert large numbers?
Yes! I can handle very large integers.

### Is it accurate?
Yes, the math is exact.

### Does it support negative numbers?
I focus on positive integers right now. I might add negative support later.

### Is it free?
