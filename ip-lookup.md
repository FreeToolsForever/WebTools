## FAQ
### What is an IP address?
It's your digital address. Every device on the internet has one.

### Is the location accurate?
It's usually accurate to the city level. It won't show your exact street address.

### Why does it show a different city?
That's probably where your ISP's main office or data center is located.

### Does it show my private IP?
No, I only see your public IP (the one websites see). Your private home network IP is hidden.

### Can I look up someone else's IP?
Yes! If you have an IP address, type it in and I'll tell you where it is.

### Do you save my IP?
No! I respect your privacy. I don't log or store your IP history.

### What is IPv6?
It's the new, longer type of IP address because we ran out of the old ones (IPv4).
