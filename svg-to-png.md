## Definition
The SVG to PNG Converter transforms Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) into Portable Network Graphics (PNG). SVGs are resolution-independent and look sharp at any size, but they aren't supported everywhere (e.g., some social media platforms, email clients, or older software). This tool allows you to render your SVG into a standard PNG image. You can specify the output dimensions, allowing you to generate a high-resolution PNG from a small vector file without any pixelation.

## Benefits
- High Quality: Render SVGs to PNG at any resolution without pixelation
- Compatibility: Create images for social media and Office apps
- Transparency: Perfectly preserves the transparent background of SVGs
- Privacy: 100% Client-side processing
- Custom Size: Scale your vector up to 4K or higher before converting
- Fast Rendering: Uses browser-native Canvas API for speed
- No Software: Convert vectors without installing Illustrator or Inkscape
- Best & Free: The best free SVG to PNG converter for designers

## FAQ
### Why convert SVG to PNG?
SVGs are great for code, but PNGs are better for sharing on Twitter, Slack, or putting in a PowerPoint.

### Can I scale it up?
Yes! Since SVG is vector, you can make it huge (like 4000px wide) and it will still look perfectly sharp.

### Does it support animations?
I take a snapshot of the first frame. If your SVG moves, I'll capture it as a still image.

### Is it secure?
Yes. I use your browser's own rendering engine to do the conversion.

### Does it handle custom fonts?
If the font is on your computer, it will look perfect. If not, it might look a little different.

### Can I convert PNG to SVG?
No, that's really hard to do automatically. I only go from Vector (SVG) to Raster (PNG).

### Is transparency preserved?
Yes! Your transparent background stays transparent.
