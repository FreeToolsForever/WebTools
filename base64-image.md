## Definition
The Base64 Image Encoder is a developer tool that converts an image file into a Base64-encoded string. Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that represents binary data (like an image) in an ASCII string format. This string can be embedded directly into HTML (using the <img> tag) or CSS (background-image), eliminating the need for a separate HTTP request to fetch the image file. This is particularly useful for small icons, logos, or email signatures where you want to ensure the image loads instantly and doesn't break if the external file is missing.

## Benefits
- Reduce HTTP Requests: Speed up page loads by inlining small images
- Email Friendly: Embed logos directly in email signatures (no broken links)
- Universal Support: Works in all modern browsers and email clients

## FAQ
### Does Base64 increase file size?
Yes, it makes the file about 33% bigger. It's best for tiny icons, not big photos.

### When should I use Base64?
Use it for small logos or icons so your website doesn't have to make a separate request to the server.

### Is it secure?
Yes. I encode everything locally on your device.

### What formats are supported?
I can handle anything! JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG, WebP... you name it.

### Can I decode Base64 back to an image?
Yes! Just paste the string into your browser's address bar (with 'data:image...') and it will show up.

### Does it work with SVG?
Yes! Converting SVG to Base64 is a pro move for using vector icons in CSS background images.

### Is there a size limit?
No hard limit, but if you try to encode a 10MB photo, your browser might freeze for a second.
