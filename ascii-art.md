## FAQ
### What is ASCII?
It's the old-school way of making pictures with text characters. It's from the 60s but still looks cool today.

### Will it look right everywhere?
It looks best in 'monospace' fonts (like in code editors or terminals). In Word or on Facebook, it might look a bit wobbly if the font isn't fixed-width.

### Can I use this in emails?
Yes, but make sure you set your email to 'Plain Text' or use a font like Courier New.

### How do I paste this into Discord or Slack?
Put three backticks (```) before and after your art. That tells Discord to treat it like code and keep it straight.

### Is it accessible for screen readers?
Not really. Screen readers will just read 'slash slash pipe underscore'. It's best to add a caption describing the image.

### Does it support emojis?
I use standard keyboard characters. If you want emojis, that's a different kind of art!

### Is there a character limit?
No, but if you make it too wide, it might wrap on mobile screens and look broken.
