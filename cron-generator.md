## Definition
The Cron Job Generator is a visual helper for creating 'cron' schedules. Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like computer operating systems. Users who set up and maintain software environments use cron to schedule jobs (commands or shell scripts) to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals. The syntax (e.g., '*/5 * * * *') can be confusing. This tool allows you to select options like 'Every 5 minutes' or 'At 3:00 AM on Mondays' via a friendly UI, and it generates the correct crontab string for you.

## FAQ
### What is a Cron Job?
It's a scheduled task on a server. Like setting an alarm clock for your computer.

### What do the 5 asterisks mean?
Minute, Hour, Day, Month, Weekday. I help you fill them in correctly.

### How do I use the result?
Copy the string I give you and paste it into your server's crontab file.

### Does it support seconds?
No, standard cron only goes down to minutes. If you need seconds, you need a different tool.

### What is */5?
It means 'every 5'. So */5 in minutes means 'every 5 minutes'.

### Is it accurate?
Yes, I generate perfect standard cron syntax every time.

### Can I verify an existing string?
I'm a generator, not a validator. But if you can build it here, it's valid!
