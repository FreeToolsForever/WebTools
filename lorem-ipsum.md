## Definition
Lorem Ipsum is the industry-standard placeholder text used in publishing, graphic design, and web development. It is derived from a scrambled section of 'De finibus bonorum et malorum', a 1st-century BC Latin text by Cicero. Designers use it to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful content. This tool allows you to generate custom lengths of Lorem Ipsum text—paragraphs, sentences, or words—to fit your specific layout needs. It ensures that the viewer's attention is focused on the design elements rather than reading the text.
