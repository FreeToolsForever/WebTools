## FAQ
### What is Title Case?
It capitalizes the big words but leaves small words like 'and', 'the', and 'of' lowercase. Perfect for headlines!

### What is Sentence case?
It capitalizes only the very first letter of the sentence. Like normal writing.

### Can I convert code variables?
Yes! I have special modes for camelCase, snake_case, and kebab-case just for programmers.

### Is the conversion reversible?
Mostly yes, but if you convert to 'lowercase', you lose the original capitalization forever.

### Does it handle accents?
Yes. 'é' becomes 'É' in uppercase. I handle all special characters correctly.

### What is PascalCase?
It's like camelCase, but the first letter is Big too (e.g., 'MyClass'). Used a lot in C# and React.

### What is Kebab Case?
It puts hyphens between words (e.g., 'my-cool-class'). It's standard for CSS and URLs.

### Is there a text limit?
No limit! Paste as much as you want.
