## FAQ
### Does it support GitHub Flavored Markdown?
Yes! I support tables, task lists, and strikethrough, just like GitHub.

### Can I convert HTML back to Markdown?
Not right now. I only go from Markdown to HTML. I'm working on the other way!

### Does it sanitize the HTML?
No. I give you the raw HTML. If you put this on a public website, make sure you sanitize it first to stop XSS attacks.

### Can I use custom CSS?
The preview looks standard, but the HTML I give you is plain. You can style it however you want with your own CSS.

### Does it support math formulas?
I focus on standard Markdown. I don't do complex math (LaTeX) yet.

### Can I export to PDF?
The easiest way is to use your browser's 'Print' button and choose 'Save as PDF'.

### Is it real-time?
Yes! As fast as you type, I update the preview.
