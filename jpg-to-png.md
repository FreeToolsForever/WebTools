## Definition
The JPG to PNG Converter transforms images from JPG/JPEG format to PNG. While JPG is great for photos, PNG is a lossless format that is better for editing, as it doesn't degrade quality each time you save it. This tool takes your compressed JPG and saves it as a high-quality PNG. Note that this won't magically restore quality lost during the original JPG compression, but it prevents further loss during future edits.

## FAQ
### Will the file size increase?
Yes. PNGs are larger because they don't compress the image as much as JPGs. This keeps the quality high.

### Does this improve quality?
No. I can't add quality that isn't there. But converting to PNG stops the quality from getting worse if you save it again.

### Can I add transparency?
This tool just changes the file type. To remove the background, you need a Background Remover tool.

### Is it secure?
Yes. Everything happens on your device.

### What is the difference between JPG and JPEG?
They are exactly the same! .jpg is just the 3-letter version of .jpeg.

### Can I convert other formats?
I only do JPG to PNG here. Check my other tools for more options.

### Is there a limit?
No limit, but huge files depend on how much memory your computer has.
