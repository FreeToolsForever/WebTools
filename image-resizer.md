## Definition
An Image Resizer is a tool used to change the dimensions (width and height) of a digital image. Whether you need to shrink a high-resolution photo for a website, adjust an image for social media, or reduce dimensions for email attachments, this tool makes it easy. It allows you to specify exact pixel dimensions or resize by a percentage (e.g., 50% smaller). The tool includes an 'Aspect Ratio' lock to prevent distortion, ensuring your images don't look stretched or squashed. All resizing happens locally in your browser, guaranteeing privacy.

## FAQ
### Does resizing reduce quality?
Making an image smaller usually looks great. Making it bigger can make it look blurry or pixelated.

### Can I resize multiple images?
I focus on one image at a time to give you precise control over the dimensions.

### What formats are supported?
I work with all the popular ones: JPG, PNG, and WebP.

### Is my image uploaded?
No. I resize everything right here in your browser using your computer's power.

### How do I keep the shape correct?
Keep 'Lock Aspect Ratio' checked. If you change the width, I'll automatically fix the height so it doesn't look squashed.

### Can I resize by file size (KB)?
I resize by pixels. If you want to make the file size smaller (KB) without changing the dimensions, use my Image Compressor tool.

### Does it remove EXIF data?
Yes, creating a new resized image usually strips out the old metadata.
