## Definition
An Image Compressor is a vital tool for web developers, designers, and content creators who need to optimize visual assets for the web. Large image files are the leading cause of slow website load times, which hurts user experience and SEO rankings. This tool uses advanced compression algorithms to significantly reduce the file size of your JPG and PNG images without a noticeable loss in visual quality. Unlike other online compressors that require you to upload your photos to a remote server—raising privacy concerns—this tool performs all compression locally in your browser using WebAssembly technology. This means your personal photos, design assets, or sensitive documents never leave your computer. You can batch process multiple images at once, adjust compression levels to find the perfect balance between size and quality, and download the optimized files instantly. It's the fastest, safest way to prepare images for websites, emails, or storage.
