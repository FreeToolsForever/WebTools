## Definition
The Aspect Ratio Calculator helps you find the missing dimension of an image or video while maintaining a specific aspect ratio. An aspect ratio is the proportional relationship between the width and height of a display or image (e.g., 16:9 for HD video). If you know the width and the ratio, this tool calculates the height, and vice versa. It's crucial for resizing content without distortion.
