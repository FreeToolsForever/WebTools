## Definition
A Text Diff Checker is a utility that compares two blocks of text and highlights the differences between them. It is widely used by developers to compare code versions, writers to track changes in drafts, and legal professionals to review contract revisions. This tool uses a 'diff' algorithm to identify lines that have been added, removed, or modified. It presents the comparison in a side-by-side or inline view, using color-coding (typically green for additions and red for deletions) to make the changes instantly visible. Our tool processes the text locally in your browser, ensuring that your sensitive code or documents are never uploaded to a server.

## Benefits
- Visual Comparison: Instantly spot differences with color-coded highlighting
- Side-by-Side View: Compare texts in a clear, split-pane layout
- Privacy: 100% Client-side processing; sensitive docs stay private
- Multi-Format: Works perfectly with code, JSON, XML, or plain text
- Line Numbers: Quickly reference specific changes by line

## FAQ
### Is my data secure?
Yes. I compare everything right here in your browser. Nothing is sent to a server, so your code and documents are safe.

### Does it support code syntax highlighting?
I focus on highlighting the *differences* first. Syntax highlighting is coming soon!

### Can I compare files?
Just copy and paste the text from your files. I'll handle thousands of lines without breaking a sweat.

### Is there a limit on text size?
I can handle very large files. If your browser can handle the copy-paste, I can handle the diff.

### Does it ignore whitespace?
I show every difference, including spaces, because sometimes a space makes a big difference in code.

### Can I share the results?
Yes! Click 'Share' to get a link. Just remember, the link contains the text, so don't share sensitive passwords.

### Does it work offline?
Yes. Once you're here, you don't need the internet to compare text.

### What algorithm does it use?
I use the Myers diff algorithm. It's the industry standard for finding the shortest set of changes.
