## FAQ
### Does cropping reduce resolution?
Yes, because you are cutting out parts of the image. The new image will be smaller in pixels than the original.

### Can I undo a crop?
Yes! You can adjust the box as much as you want before you download.

### What is aspect ratio?
It's the shape of the image. 1:1 is a square (like Instagram). 16:9 is a rectangle (like YouTube).

### Is it secure?
Yes. Your photos stay on your device. I don't see them.

### Can I crop into a circle?
I crop to a square. When you upload it to Instagram or Twitter, they will cut it into a circle for you.

### Does it support transparent PNGs?
Yes! If you crop a transparent PNG, the background stays transparent.

### Is there a file size limit?
I can handle most images, but if you try to load a massive 50MB raw photo, your browser might slow down.
